Part Name: Simple Mounting Bracket
Material: Aluminum 6061-T6
Dimensions: Rectangular block, 100mm long, 50mm wide, 20mm thick.
Features:
1. The top surface (100x50mm) needs to be faced to achieve a clean, flat finish.
2. Four (4) M6 through-holes need to be drilled. The holes are located at each corner, 10mm in from each edge.
The raw stock is slightly larger than the final dimensions.
